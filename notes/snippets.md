The atoms or gas in the outer layers of a star are passive players in the game. While they produce the radiation that eventually reaches our telescopes and detectors, the kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules is dictated by energy flowing up from the deeper interior. Energy is transferred to these atoms and molecules by radiation (true even if convection is occurring). The resulting kinetic energy imparted to the individual constituents of the gas ultimately dictates the density and pressure (temperature being a "measure" of the average kinetic energy).

This is discussed by Eddington (1926) 

> The Sun does not radiate 6x10^10 ergs per square centimeter per second _because_ it's 6000 K.; its photosphere is maintained at 6000 K because 6x10^10 ergs are streaming through it. It is under the temperature gradient in the interior that the radiant stream gathers way; the surface layers cannot dam the flow since their capacity for storing energy is insignificant; they can only adjust themselves to let it through.
