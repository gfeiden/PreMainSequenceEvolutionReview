Numerous complications with star formation theory about the collapse of a cold gas cloud into stars. _Perhaps a brief summary is in order, but this may depend on which group (or groups) one choses to align with._

Only when the ratio of specific heats Cp/Cv == 5/3 will half of the gravitational potential energy be converted into internal energy. If Cp/Cv < 5/3 (as is typical), more gravitational potential energy will be converted to internal energy during the collapse (Sears & Brownlee). _Causes a rise in T and L with a decrease in R_.

EOS and opacity were noted by S & B to be sufficiently unknown in the cool rarefied gas of a collapsing star. They also claim that the assumption of B ~ 0 G is appropriate and that rotation does not play a major role. Yet,

> It should be noted that convection could be inhibited by hydromagnetic forces and that the Coriolis force is a stabilizing influence. Until these effects are considered carefully, no definitive decision between a convective and a radiative model can be made (noted by Alfv√©n).

__Comment__: the presence of strong surface magnetic fields among young stars suggests the presence of a magnetic dynamo mechanism, indicating that convection is present in the outer layers of young stars.

Delayed contraction times depend on interior structure and could reveal dominant internal energy transport mechanisms (e.g., Brownlee & Cox 1961, Ezer & Cameron 1963)... if D exists in suffient quantity.

It would be instructive to present evidence in favor of convection as the dominant energy transport mechanism early in the lives of stars.
