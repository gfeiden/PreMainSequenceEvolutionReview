Chapter in "Stellar Structure" (ed. Aller & McLaughlin) by Sears & Brownlee provides a concise description of pre-main-sequence evolution. Written around 1965, this is contemporary with Hayashi et al.'s assertion that convection is the primary energy transport mechanism in protostars.
> The very earliest stage in the evolution of a star has not been satisfactorily explained, through a growing number of attempts to delimit the problem have been made in recent years. 

On deuterium:

  - Bashkin & Peaslee (1961) &ndash; no D in ISM?
  - Fowler, Greenstein, & Hoyle (1962) &ndash; no D in ISM?
  - Salpeter (1954) &ndash; D fusion causes pause in contraction
 
Delayed contraction times depend on interior structure and could reveal dominant internal energy transport mechanisms (e.g., Brownlee & Cox 1961, Ezer & Cameron 1963)... if D exists in suffient quantity.
